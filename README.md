Building products and servicees to empower people and enrich their lives.

## What I Do üíª

I focus on building the parts of websites you see and interact with. I'm really comfortable with the core technologies of the web:

*   **HTML:** The foundation of web content.
*   **CSS:** Making things look pretty and organized.
*   **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamic features. I'm quite good with modern JavaScript (ES6+) and am learning TypeScript too!

I also have experience with:

*   **React:** My go-to JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I'm open to working with Angular or Vue.js as well.
*   **CSS Preprocessors (Sass, Less):** They help me write CSS more efficiently.
*   **Build Tools (Webpack, Vite):** I use them to manage and optimize project files.
*   **Testing (Jest, Mocha, Selenium):** I believe in writing tests to ensure the code works as expected.

## My Approach ‚ú®

I enjoy collaborating with others to turn ideas into reality. I'm always looking for ways to improve and learn new things in the ever-evolving world of web development. I like to keep things simple and build user-friendly experiences.
