				<h1>Building Community Through Public Art</h1>
				<p>In 1992, a group of community leaders in Portsmouth, Ohio
					asked, "How can we create pride in our community, improve
					the local economy, and change a dying part of town into the
					vibrant place it once was?"</p>
				<img src="images/bg_nightpaint.jpg" alt="">
				<p>This is the story of the local visionaries and extraordinary
					artists who transformed a drab 2,200-foot section of the
					town's floodwall into a vast display of public art, history,
					and pride.</p>

				<h2>The Artists</h2>
				<img src="images/dafford_small.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Robert Dafford of Lafayette, Louisiana, was chosen as lead
					artist for the floodwall mural project. An internationally
					known muralist with over 30 years of experience, Robert has
					created more than 400 murals throughout the United States,
					Canada, and Europe.</p>
				<p>Viewers will notice that many of the panels bear a
					three-dimensional illusion: a hallmark of Dafford's style
					that connects the audience to the artwork in a unique and
					powerful way.</p>
				<p>Dafford and his associate artists, including Portsmouth
					native Herb Roe, are contracted to maintain the Portsmouth
					Floodwall murals, keeping them vibrant despite the elements.
					Their painting season in Portsmouth is from May through
					September, where visitors may catch a glimpse of the artists
					in action.</p>

				<h2>The Murals</h2>
				<p>The floodwall mural project is an outdoor art gallery
					depicting the many centuries of Portsmouth, Ohio area
					history. Subjects range from the ancient mound building
					Adena and Hopewell cultures to historic sports figures and
					local notables like actor Roy Rogers, painter Clarence
					Carter, baseball manager Branch Rickey, writer Jesse Stuart,
					and actress Julia Marlowe.</p>
				<p>The section of floodwall included in the project is 20 feet
					high and extends for 2,090 feet along Front Street in the
					historic Boneyfiddle District of downtown Portsmouth.
					Painting began in 1993. The murals are arranged
					chronologically from east to west, starting with the
					depiction of the Mound Builders, who are ancestors of the
					Shawnee Indians, and ending with murals from the
					contemporary era.</p>
