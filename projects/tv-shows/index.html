					in technology the

					it: it's annoying, it's a tool for ignoring what you don't
					want to see or do,
					it's the ultimate in communications. There have been
					episodes about parents hurt
					when their kids avoid their Facebook friend requests. One of
					the most
					realistic—and yet so obviously product-placed—was all about
					Phil Dunphy's rabid
					desire for the original iPad back in 2010, and the hoops his
					family went through
					to get him one, including standing in line at the Apple
					Store (remember when
					that was a thing?). In 2015, they even did an entire episode
					shot entirely on
					iPhones and iPads, putting FaceTime through its paces.</p>

				<p class="show-desc">
					Person of Interest is an American science fiction crime
					drama television
					series that aired on CBS from September 22, 2011, to June
					21, 2016. Its
					five seasons comprise 103 episodes. The series was created
					by Jonathan Nolan;
					executive producers were Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Bryan Burk,
					Greg Plageman, Denise
					Thé, and Chris Fisher. The series centers on a mysterious
					reclusive billionaire computer programmer,
					Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who has developed a computer
					program for the
					federal government known as "the Machine" that is capable of
					collating all
					sources of information to predict terrorist acts and to
					identify people planning
					them. The Machine also identifies perpetrators and victims
					of other premeditated
					deadly crimes; however, because the government considers
					these "irrelevant",
					Finch programs the Machine to delete this information each
					night. Anticipating
					abuse of his creation, and tormented by the deaths that
					might have been
					prevented, Finch limited its communication to the provision
					of a tiny piece of
					information, the social security numbers of these "persons
					of interest" to
					investigate, who might be victims, perpetrators, or innocent
					bystanders in a
					lethal event, and programs the Machine to notify him
					secretly of the
					"irrelevant" numbers. The first episode shows how Finch
					recruited John Reese
					(Jim Caviezel) – a former Green Beret and CIA agent, now
					presumed dead – to
					investigate the person identified by the number the Machine
					has provided, and to
					act accordingly. As time passes, others join the team.

					Black Mirror is a British anthology television series
					created by Charlie

					near-future dystopias utilising a science fiction
					technology—a type of
					speculative fiction. The series is based on The Twilight
					Zone and uses
					technology to comment on contemporary social issues. Most
					episodes are written
					by Brooker, with heavy involvement by the executive producer
					Annabel Jones.

					There are 22 episodes across five series and one special, in
					addition to the
					interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (2018). The
					first two series aired
					on the British network Channel 4 in 2011 and 2013, as did
					the 2014 special
					"White Christmas". The programme then moved to Netflix,
					where three further

					series were produced
					by Netflix, and a companion book to the first four series,
					Inside Black Mirror,
					was published in 2018. Soundtracks to many episodes have
					been released as
					albums.

					The series has received critical acclaim and is considered
					by many reviewers to
					be one of the best television series of the 2010s. With "San

					Callister" and Bandersnatch, the programme won the Primetime
					Emmy Award for
					Outstanding Television Movie three times consecutively.
					However, some critics
